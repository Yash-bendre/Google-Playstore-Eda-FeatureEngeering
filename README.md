# 📱 EDA and Feature Engineering on Google Play Store Dataset

##📌 Problem Statement

Today, over 1.85 million apps are available for users to download on Android, with 2.56 million apps accessible through the Google Play Store. 
These apps play a huge role in our daily lives.

## This project focuses on:

Finding the most popular app category.

Identifying the app with the highest number of installs.

Detecting the app with the largest size.

Uncovering patterns and insights from the data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering.

## 📦 Dataset Information

Number of columns: 20

Number of rows: 10,841

The dataset was collected from the Google Play Store via Kaggle.

## 🧭 Steps Followed

Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Fixing incorrect data types

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate and bivariate analysis

Visualizations using matplotlib/seaborn

Distribution of installs, ratings, size, etc.

## Feature Engineering

Converting categorical data into numerical

Creating new features (e.g., app age, size category)

Transforming skewed data

## 📊 Tools and Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Key Insights

The most popular category by number of installs is: Family

The app with the highest installs is: 1147

The average app rating is: 4.0
